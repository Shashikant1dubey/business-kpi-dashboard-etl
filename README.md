# 🚀 ETL Pipeline Workflow

The ETL process performs the following operations automatically:

### 1. Detect CSV Files

Scans the `data/raw` folder for incoming datasets.

---

### 2. Read Data

Loads CSV files using Pandas.

---

### 3. Data Cleaning

* Standardizes column names
* Removes unwanted spaces
* Converts text to lowercase
* Handles invalid dates

---

### 4. Incremental Loading

Reads the `etl_control` table and only loads records with new `row_id` values.

This prevents duplicate loading.

---

### 5. Stage Data

Loads cleaned data into:

```
sales_raw
```

---

### 6. Populate Dimension Tables

Automatically loads:

* dim_customer
* dim_product
* dim_region
* dim_date

using deduplication logic.

---

### 7. Populate Fact Table

Loads transactional sales data into:

```
fact_sales
```

while preventing duplicate records.

---

### 8. Update ETL Control

Updates:

```
last_loaded_row_id
last_run
```

for future incremental executions.

---

### 9. Archive Files

Successfully processed files are moved to:

```
data/archive/
```

---

### 10. Error Handling

Failed files are automatically moved to:

```
data/failed/
```

and detailed logs are generated.

---

# ⭐ Data Warehouse Design

The project follows a **Star Schema** architecture.

## Fact Table

```
fact_sales
```

Contains transactional sales records.

## Dimension Tables

```
dim_customer

dim_product

dim_region

dim_date
```

This design improves analytical query performance and simplifies reporting.

# 📝 Logging & Monitoring

The ETL pipeline uses **Loguru** for production logging.

Logs include:

* Pipeline start
* File detection
* Processing status
* Record counts
* Errors
* Successful loads
* Archive actions

Example:

```
Pipeline Started

Files Found: 1

9800 rows loaded into sales_raw

fact_sales loaded

ETL Control Updated

sales.csv archived

Pipeline Completed
```

MYSQL_DATABASE=business_kpi_dw
```

---

## Execute ETL Pipeline

```bash
python scripts/etl_pipeline.py
```

---

## Open Power BI Dashboard

Load:

```
powerbi/Business_KPI_Dashboard.pbix
```

and refresh the MySQL connection.
